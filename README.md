# React Hooks Repo with Examples

In this repository you will find 8 branches with different React Hooks with examples.

React Hooks are functions which let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.
React provides a few built-in Hooks, 8 of which are in this repository! You can also create your own hooks to resuse stateful 
behaviour between components, like useFetch used in this repository!

Each Commit in each branch shows a different level or use case for the hooks, with final commit being highest level.

I hope this becomes of use to you!
